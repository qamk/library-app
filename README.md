# Library App
This app was a gentle reintroduction to JavaScript (after having used Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS and SASS in the interim) and an effective introduction to the JavaScript **prototype**.

This is a simple app where one can add, remove and edit some books to add to your "library", book information is displayed on a table. There are some minor styles applied.

## JavaScript Prototype
If you are curious, the **prototype** is like an super-class (super as in above or parent) which holds the methods of an object. This super-class `object.prototype` can inherit from some other object (technically it's constructor) by using `objectA.prototype = Object.create(objectB.prototype)`, which will set *objectA*'s protoype as an instances of *objectB*.

## Discussion
This project was quite chill. Even though getting used to JavaScript syntax was pretty simple, I still had to get used to interacting with the DOM. That did take patience.
